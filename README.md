Mid week challenges for the Dev RampUp

Dev-Sprint6-Challenge:
---
The challenge is to make a web app interface so that you can have a chat bot on the web. We left it to be the last of the python challenges since it requires integrating a pretty significant (pre-written) backend portion with a frontend, which you guys can now do :)

The matcher.py code is in dev-sprint6-challenge and contains the backend to a simple AI chat bot (it does not have a very complex vocabulary, but it works). 

If you get stuck, check out our example at: http://elizabot.herokuapp.com/.

This bot is based off of Cynthia J. Martincic's paper, "A Python Pattern Matcher Project for an Introduction to Artificial Intelligence Course". This paper can be found at http://proc.isecon.org/2012/cases/2136.pdf
